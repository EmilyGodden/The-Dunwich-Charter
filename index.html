    <p>The Dunwich Charter </p>


The Dunwich Charter seeks to build on The London Charter (Denard, 2012) and offer specificity in relation to the development of immersive storytelling experiences for the cultural heritage sector in the age of planetary crisis to enable developers to work within a sustainable guiding set of principles. 

As developers in immersive tech we are building our houses on sand, or as Kluitenberg would say digital sand with a torrent of unstable ones and zeros (2006, p.59). With so many shifting variables beyond our control we don't know when our houses will fall. The Dunwich Charter is a call to developers to take back control and work within a sustainable workflow. Collectively we can tinker and hack our way to a circular and sustainable immersive storytelling sector to authentically share immersive stories on intangible cultural heritage at risk due to climate crisis. 

<p>Objectives: </p>

The Dunwich Charter addresses the sustainability of current workflows and methods in virtual heritage to propose circular methods of sustainable storytelling in the immersive industry. In addition to covering the development of immersive stories this charter maps out the afterlife of virtual heritage experiences to ensure that developers and manufacturers of hardware in the immersive sector are held accountable and monitored in terms of environmental impact to be fair and transparent to end-users.


<p> Principles: </p>

The charter covers ten principles in order to equip developers with best practice in terms of enabling the sustainable development of immersive stories.
